It's instruction set was simple and clean - inspired by the PDP-8 - and it came with a family of associated memory and I/O devices which made it easy to build a complete computer system.</p> <p></p> <p>It was also the first microprocessor that could run on a single +5V power supply which greatly simplified the design of a complete system. Other microprocessors of these early days required -5V, +5V and +12V supplies because of the NMOS technology, but Motorola added a buitin voltage inverter and doubler. The 6800 was clocked at 1 MHz while an improved version could run at 2 MHz. This interesting Wikipedia article describes the history of Motorola and how the 6800 was eventually created.</p> <p>In 1978 Motorola introduced a greatly improved microprocessor, the MC6809. It was an 8-bit processort with a richer instruction set and several 16-bit instructions.</p> <p>One key diffence between the Motorola and Intel processors was the I/O addressing. The Intel microprocessors used specific I/O ports seperate from regular memory space while the Motorola 680x microprocessers placed I/O devices in the RAM/ROM memory space and therefor needed no seperate I/O instructions.</p>"},{"location":"M680x/#motorola-mc6800-evaluation-kit-ii","title":"Motorola MC6800 Evaluation Kit II","text":"<p>After having played around with the Elektuur SC/MP II for a while, I was ready for a next step and bought a kit based on the MC6800, consisting of all the parts which had to be soldered on the provided PCB's.

It featured a separate keyboard with hexadecimal keys and a 6-digit LED display, but also featured an RS-232 asynchronous serial interface for a Teletype or other terminal. There was an on-board debug program called JBUG fitted in a 1k ROM, and another popular monitor program for this system was MIKBUG. The maximum RAM capacity on board was 512 bytes (4 x MC6810), but this could be expanded via the Motorola EXORciser computer bus interface.

This Kit, when assembled, was a fully functional microcomputer system based on the MC6800 Microprocessing Unit (MPU).</p> <p>I bought this Kit as my second microcomputer, after the National Semiconductor SC/MP II, and created various simple programs, inluding Mastermind. The standard Kit, consiting of a Microcomputer Module and a Keyboard/Display Module, included:</p> <ul> <li>The MC6800 MPU.</li> <li>The JBUG monitor in a MCM6830 1K x  8 bit ROM (SCM44520P).</li> <li>3 MCM6810 RAM Memory modules (128 x 8 bit).</li> <li>2 MC6820 Peripheral Interface Adapters (PIA's)had some fun with it.</li> </ul> <p>Because both the MPU and the serial interface use the same clock, the MPU is running at only 614.4 kHz generated by a MC6871B, even though it is capable of running at 1 MHz. This provides a simple means of obtaining a 4800 Hz clock for the 300 baud serial data tape cassette interface as well as the ACIA by just dividing the MC6871B provided double clock output by 256.</p> <p>Programs could be stored on, and loaded from, ordinary audio cassettes using the \"Kansas City Standard\" recording format, so called due to its formulation during a symposium sponsored by BYTE Magazine in Kansas City, Missouri, in November 1975.</p>"},{"location":"M680x/MEK6800D2/#overview-of-my-inventory","title":"Overview of my inventory","text":"<p>Next to the Kit, I also have various manuals and books as well as alternative monitor programs and sample programs.</p> <p>The official manual that came with the Kit. \" alt=\"MEK6800D2 manual\" src=\"assets/M680x/assets/\" /&gt;}</p>"}]}
