# My Retro Computing documentation

This [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) based site will eventually contain all the information I collected or created about seventies and eighties microcomputers once owned, still own or would like to own.
Be aware, that it is currently in its early stages.
